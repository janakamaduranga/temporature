1) Technologies used
Spring boot, WebFlux, MongoDb

Justification for technology selection
a) Due to performance and nature of data decided to use MongoDB. Temperature data
is not relational therefore chose a no sql data base

b) Decided to go with WebFlux due to non blocking nature which finally
deliver better performance

2) Run the project. There are two options to run
a) Go to command line, move to project directory
and run "mvn spring-boot:run"
b) Import to an IDE and run TemporatureApplication

3) Swagger API documentation can be accessed in
http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/

4) Import "TemperatureAPI.postman_collection.json" file which is in the
